Nested Mapping and Sequence:


users:
  - name: John
    age: 30
  - name: Alice
    age: 25
In this example, there is a list of users, and each user has a name and an age.

Aliases (Anchors) and References:



people:
  - &person
    name: John
    age: 30
  - <<: *person
    name: Alice
Here, an anchor (&person) is used to define a template for a person. The << notation is used to reference and reuse the template for Alice.

Multi-Line Strings (Literal Block):


description: |
  This is a multi-line
  string in .
  It preserves newlines and formatting.
#The | symbol indicates a literal block style, which preserves newlines and indentation.

Custom Tags:



date: !!timestamp '2023-09-20T15:30:00Z'
 #allows you to use custom tags to define data types. Here, !!timestamp is used to specify a timestamp.

Map Merging:



default_settings:
  host: localhost
  port: 8080

user_settings:
  <<: *default_settings
  port: 9090
#The << notation is used to merge the user_settings map with the default_settings, and then it overrides the port value.

Flow Style (Compact):



colors: { primary: 'red', secondary: 'blue' }
# supports a compact "flow" style for dictionaries (maps) and lists (sequences) where items are enclosed in curly braces {} and square brackets [], respectively.

#Document Separation (Multiple Documents in One File):

name: Alice
age: 25

name: Bob
age: 32
